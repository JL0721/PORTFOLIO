		  <P class="bio"> 
	       	  It has been about 10 years since I was first introduced to HTML and CSS. Now starting over from the fundamentals, one of my goals now is to continue aquiring skills that will allow me to gain first hand experience in the industry. I also want to identify my strengths, as well as weaknesses. So far I really enjoy front-end development, but I would like to get more information about other career paths that I may be just as passionate about.
